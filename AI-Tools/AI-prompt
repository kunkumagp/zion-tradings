# AI Context and Instructions

## Project Overview
This is a CodeIgniter 4 inventory management system with the following components:

### Database Tables
- **users**: User management with roles (admin, manager, trader, viewer) and authentication

### Current Environment
- PHP 8.4.1
- CodeIgniter 4.6.3
- MySQL database: inventory_system_db
- Development server: http://localhost:8080

### Project Structure
- Database migrations in: app/Database/Migrations/
- Models in: app/Models/
- Controllers in: app/Controllers/
- Views in: app/Views/

## Current Status
- âœ… Database setup complete
- âœ… Users table created
- âœ… User seeder created (admin + sample users)
- âœ… Admin template integrated
- âœ… Dashboard UI implemented
- âœ… MySQL connection working
- ðŸ”„ Need to build: Authentication, CRUD operations, User management

## Instructions for AI
